    "First let's talk about object oriented programming. The central premise is that by coding we make objects, which can be used again in new contexts. This is incredibly powerful, and not only streamlines code, but in some cases makes coding something possible where otherwise it would be impossible. Let's [read](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming) just a bit about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a theoretical concept that drives the way we apply code. Consider the flowcharts we've been using. If you think about it, we could take the page that you write your flowchart on, and consider that page an 'object'. We could then string together those pages (and even photocopy them) to make an even bigger program. This is, in fact, what we see in computer science. Consider [universal modeling language](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming).\n",

    "It would seem that functions are the objects we have been looking for, but as it turns out they are too small to be the fully fledged objects we're looking for. Here we introduce classes. A class is a template for creating objects. The difference is that a function runs code, whereas a class can represent an object. Let's imagine that we're using computer programming for taxonomy. We might make a class: `cats`, but that's not an object yet. It's not until we instantiate that class with a particular cat `Meowser`. This object will have the template `cats`, but might change based on the specific parameters of `Meowser`. That's what we see in computer programming.\n",
